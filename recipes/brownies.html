<h3>ingredients</h3>
<ul><li>1/2 c sugar</li>
    <li>8 tbs butter, cold</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
    <li>3/4 c cocoa</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>3/4 c 1:1 gluten free flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 c chocolate chips</li></ul>
<h3>steps</h3>
 <ol><li>preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease an 8" square pan</li>
    <li>place the sugar, butter, and salt in a microwave-safe bowl or saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring with a heatproof spatula until the butter melts and the mixture lightens in color. This step helps melt the sugar, which will give the brownies a shiny crust.</li>
    <li>If you've heated the sugar and butter in a saucepan, transfer the mixture to a bowl; otherwise, just leave the hot ingredients right in their microwave-safe bowl. Blend in the vanilla and cocoa, then add the eggs and mix until shiny.</li>
    <li>blend in the flour and the baking powder. stir in the chocolate chips</li>
<li>pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it to the edges.</li>
<li>bake the brownies for 33 to 38 minutes, until the top is set; and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or nearly so, with perhaps a few wet crumbs, or a tiny touch of chocolate at the tip of the tester.</li>
<li>remove from the oven and cool for about 15 minutes before cutting. Once the brownies are cool, cover tightly with plastic.
